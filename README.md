# C9 - Server

**C9** is a web-based RDP gateway with an on-premise forwarder that allows access to servers on private networks without a VPN connection.

C9 is forked from [**mstsc.js**](https://github.com/citronneur/mstsc.js), a pure Javascript Microsoft RDP (Remote Desktop Client) client using node.js, [**node-rdpjs**](https://github.com/citronneur/node-rdpjs) and socket.io. It allows you to connect to any terminal server compatible application, through a web browser (optimized for Firefox, but compatible with Chrome and Internet Explorer 11 too).

## How mstsc.js works

### Front-end

The frontend application uses socket.io and canvas for binding with mstsc.js backend. The front-end is in charge of bitmap decompression through rle.js file. This file is generated by [**Emscripten**](https://github.com/kripken/emscripten) from [rle.c](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/citronneur/mstsc.js/master/obj/rle.c) which comes from rdesktop source.

### Back-end

The backend application uses node.js, express and socket.io as the web server. The main goal of the backend is to be a proxy between the web browser and the terminal server. It uses [**node-rdpjs**](https://github.com/citronneur/node-rdpjs) for its rdp client.
